This project is a basic clone of the Google homepage, created using HTML and CSS. It features a central search bar for users to type queries or URLs, alongside links to popular social media platforms such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Spotify, Amazon, and ChatGPT. The layout is responsive and includes a full-screen background image, with icons from Font Awesome used for a clean and modern look. The page also includes interactive microphone and camera icons, although they are currently non-functional. To use this project, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. This clone offers a great starting point for learning web development and experimenting with different front-end design concepts.
